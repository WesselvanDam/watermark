# Watermarker tool
This is a simple tool to watermark images, written with Flutter. It was created to aid the board of AEGEE-Leiden in watermarking photos made during events. 

Note: the code is notably ugly, as it is not written with the intention of being maintained. Feel free to use it as a reference, but don't expect it to be a good example of how to write Flutter code.

# Features
It allows users to specify a source directory, a watermark image, and an output directory. You can specify the position and size of the watermark image. One by one, the tool will show you the image, such that you can decide whether to watermark it or not. The tool will then save the watermarked image to the output directory.
